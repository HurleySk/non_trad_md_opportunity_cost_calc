- **Impact**: Can exceed lost wages due to compound growth

#### Training Costs
- **What it means**: Direct expenses for education and living

## üéØ Optimization Strategies

### Timeline Optimization
The calculator suggests optimal timing:

```
OPTIMIZATION SUGGESTIONS:
- Consider starting medical school at age 28 instead of 31
- This could reduce opportunity cost by $150,000
- Earlier start means more years of physician salary
```

### Financial Planning
Strategies to minimize costs:

```
FINANCIAL STRATEGIES:
- Increase retirement contributions before medical school
- Consider part-time work during post-bacc
- Explore loan forgiveness programs
- Optimize loan repayment strategy
```

### Career Planning
When additional training makes sense:

```
CAREER TIMING:
- Fellowship adds $200,000 to opportunity cost
- But increases salary by $50,000/year
- Break-even occurs after 4 years of practice
```

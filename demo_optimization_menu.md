# Optimization Menu Demonstration

This document demonstrates the new post-calculation optimization menu that helps users understand how to reach break-even earlier.

## How It Works

After running a calculation, the application automatically displays an optimization suggestions menu:

```
=== OPTIMIZATION SUGGESTIONS ===
Would you like to see suggestions for reaching break-even earlier?
1. Loan repayment optimization strategies
2. Target salary recommendations
3. Skip optimization suggestions
Enter choice (1-3):
```

## Option 1: Loan Repayment Optimization

This option analyzes how aggressive loan repayment can accelerate break-even:

### Current Situation Analysis
- Shows your current break-even age
- Displays age when starting practice
- Calculates years to break-even after starting
- Shows current monthly payment and term

### Aggressive Repayment Scenarios
- **5-year aggressive repayment**: Calculates if 5-year term improves break-even age
- **7-year moderate repayment**: Analyzes 7-year term benefits
- **Years saved**: Shows how many years earlier you can break even

### Custom Target Analysis
- Enter a target break-even age
- Calculates required repayment term and monthly payment
- Warns about unsustainable payment levels (>50% of income)

### Example Output
```
=== LOAN REPAYMENT OPTIMIZATION ===
Current situation:
- Break-even age: 45 years old
- Age when starting practice: 33 years old
- Years to break-even after starting: 12 years
- Current monthly payment: $3,456.78 (10-year term)

=== AGGRESSIVE REPAYMENT SCENARIOS ===
5-year aggressive repayment:
- Monthly payment: $6,789.12
- Annual burden: $81,469.44
- New break-even age: 41 years old
- Years saved: 4

=== RECOMMENDATIONS ===
✅ Consider accelerating loan repayment to reach break-even sooner.
✅ Higher monthly payments reduce total interest and accelerate wealth building.
⚠️  Ensure payment levels are sustainable with your lifestyle and other expenses.
```

## Option 2: Target Salary Recommendations

This option calculates what salary increases are needed to reach break-even faster:

### Salary Optimization Scenarios
- **5-year break-even**: Target salary needed to break even in 5 years
- **10-year break-even**: Target salary for 10-year timeline
- **Retirement age break-even**: Salary needed to break even by retirement

### Analysis Features
- Shows current vs. target salary
- Calculates dollar and percentage increases needed
- Validates realistic salary ranges
- Provides strategic career advice

### Example Output
```
=== TARGET SALARY RECOMMENDATIONS ===
Current situation:
- Starting physician salary: $250,000
- Break-even age: 45 years old
- Years to break-even after starting: 12 years

=== SALARY OPTIMIZATION SCENARIOS ===
To break even in 5 years after starting practice:
- Target starting salary: $350,000
- Salary increase needed: $100,000
- Percentage increase: 40.0%

=== RECOMMENDATIONS ===
✅ Research salaries in your target specialty and geographic region.
✅ Consider subspecialty training that commands higher compensation.
✅ Negotiate aggressively for your first attending position.
✅ Explore opportunities in underserved areas that may offer higher pay.
✅ Consider combining salary increases with accelerated loan repayment.
```

## Option 3: Skip Optimization

Users can choose to skip the optimization analysis and return to the main menu.

## When Optimization Can't Help

The system intelligently detects when loan optimization won't improve break-even:

```
=== LOAN REPAYMENT OPTIMIZATION ===
Your current loan repayment strategy is already optimal!
Break-even age (33) is at or before you start practicing.
```

## Sample Scenarios

### Traditional Path (traditional_path.txt)
- Age 25, recent college graduate
- $75K current salary in entry-level position  
- No post-bacc needed, strong science background
- Standard 3-year residency, no fellowship
- Conservative estimates for a general practice physician

### Post-Bacc + Fellowship (postbacc_fellowship.txt)
- Age 30, career changer
- $80K current salary in non-medical field
- 2-year post-bacc program required
- 2-year fellowship for subspecialty
- Higher attending salary reflecting subspecialty training

### Non-Traditional, No Post-Bacc (nontraditional_no_postbacc.txt)
- Age 32, established professional
- $90K current salary, higher current income
- No post-bacc needed (previous science coursework)
- 4-year residency (longer specialty program)
- Higher retirement contribution rate (20%) due to financial sophistication
- More aggressive investment assumptions (8% return)

## Tips for Accurate Estimates

### Salary Projections
- Research average salaries in your target specialty and region
- Consider geographic cost of living differences
- Account for potential subspecialty training premium

### Loan Estimates
- Include all educational costs: tuition, fees, living expenses, books
- Research current federal loan rates (typically 5-7%)
- Consider state-specific loan programs with different rates

### Financial Assumptions
- 15% retirement savings is a common recommendation
- 7% long-term stock market return is a historical average
- Adjust based on your risk tolerance and investment strategy

### Timeline Considerations
- Be realistic about MCAT preparation and application timing
- Account for potential gap years or delayed starts
- Consider competitive residency match probabilities

## Understanding the Results

The calculator provides several key metrics:

- **Total Opportunity Cost**: Complete financial impact of medical training
- **Break-Even Age**: When physician income recovers all costs
- **Retirement Impact %**: What portion of cost comes from lost retirement savings
- **Timeline**: Clear progression through each training phase

Remember that this is a planning tool - actual results will vary based on individual circumstances, economic conditions, and career decisions.
